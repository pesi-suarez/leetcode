This repository contains solutions for some LeetCode problems I've been doing. They are all written in C#.

The repository consists of a Visual Studio solution, which itself contains three projects:
 - A class library, where the solutions to the LeetCode problems actually are.
 - A unit test project, to test said solutions.
 - A console application for further testing.
 
All of the classes in the library are named "Solution" and are located in different namespaces so the library can compile. This way we only need to copy the class to the LeetCode editor and it will run fine.
